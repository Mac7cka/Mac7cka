# 👋 Hi, I’m Marcela,

I’m on an exciting journey from curious learner to confident developer. 
I enjoy building tools that solve real-world problems — with a splash of creativity.

## 🔨 Some of my Projects 

### 🏡 [MM House Search](https://github.com/Mac7cka/MM-house-search)
A Python-based web scraping and data filtering tool that automates the discovery of relevant property listings on Byval.sk., 
with dynamic location filtering using custom logic and geolocation proximity (e.g., within 100 km or 1-hour drive from a base city).  

### 🚗 Car Listings Scraper [BMW-scraper](https://github.com/Mac7cka/BMW-scraper)
Built scrapers for car listings on **autobazar.eu** and an **Australian car site**.  
Features:
- Anti-bot measures using `undetected-chromedriver`
- Randomized user-agents
- Optional integration of uBlock Origin to remove clutter and stay stealthy

### 🏗️ Real Estate Fullstack App 
Currently building a complete property selling platform using:
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- **Back-end:** Custom admin dashboard with create/edit/delete, login/registration, favorites, and contact form
- Still working on some improvements like connecting to a live database and polishing functionality..

> Note: Some basic projects like blog sites, job bots, dashboards, games (Snake, Pong), calculator,
  generators etc. weren’t included here — I of coure made that, but I wanted to focus on personal/unique work instead.

I already build some tools in Python to solve real-life problems — like finding DREAM HOME - A Python-based web scraping and data filtering tool that automates the discovery of relevant property listings on Byval.sk., with dynamic location filtering using custom logic and geolocation proximity (e.g., within 100 km or 1-hour drive from a base city) which you can already find here (https://github.com/Mac7cka/MM-house-search.git) or some more scraping projects for cars listings in some australian page and autobazar.eu with Anti-Bot Measures - Uses undetected-chromedriver, randomized user agents, and optional uBlock Origin to avoid detection and remove clutter.

I’m currenly working on Real Estate Full Website for selling properties which icludes Front-end and Back-end using JS, React, HTML, CSS, NEXT.JS etc.. having admin dashboard with backend for creating new delas, preview, edit, delete and also favourites path , login/registration, contact form etc. 
The project is included here as well, but not finished yet! 
THere some functionalities which needs to be improved, like connecting with database, etc.

I also made projetcs like blog, Tinder bot, job automation, dashboards, snake game, pong, password generator ... from my courses, but I didnt include it here because everyone already made it, so its basic/easy not personal.
