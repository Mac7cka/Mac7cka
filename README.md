# 👋 Hi, I’m Marcela,

I’m on an exciting journey from curious learner to confident developer. 
I enjoy building tools that solve real-world problems — with a splash of creativity.

## 🔨 Some of my Projects 

### [Educational Games](https://github.com/Mac7cka/educational-games)
An interactive educational web application designed for children aged 4–5 years old to play, learn, and explore English words in a fun and engaging way. Built with HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and TailwindCSS, the app features beautiful pastel-colored watercolor illustrations, kid-friendly animations, and pronunciation support to make learning enjoyable.

### 🏡 [MM House Search](https://github.com/Mac7cka/MM-house-search)
A Python-based web scraping and data filtering tool that automates the discovery of relevant property listings on Byval.sk., 
with dynamic location filtering using custom logic and geolocation proximity (e.g., within 100 km or 1-hour drive from a base city).  

### 🚗 Car Listings Scraper [BMW-listing](https://github.com/Mac7cka/BMW-listing)/[autobazar-eu](https://github.com/Mac7cka/autobazar-eu)  
Built scrapers for car listings on **autobazar.eu** and an **Australian car site**.  
Features:
- Anti-bot measures using `undetected-chromedriver`
- Randomized user-agents
- Optional integration of uBlock Origin to remove clutter and stay stealthy

### 🏗️ Real Estate Fullstack App 
Currently building a complete property selling platform using:
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- **Back-end:** Custom admin dashboard with create/edit/delete, login/registration, favorites, and contact form
- Still working on some improvements like connecting to a live database and polishing functionality..

> Note: Some basic projects like blog sites, job bots, dashboards, games (Snake, Pong), calculator,
  generators etc. weren’t included here — I of coure made that, but I wanted to focus on personal/unique work instead.
